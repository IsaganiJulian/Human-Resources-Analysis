# Human Resources Analysis Project
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on human resources data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set. Various data analysis techniques and tools such as Excel, SQL, and Tableau were utilized for this project. A docx file can be found in my files, which states a more detailed outline of my project.

### Project Overview
The Human Resources Analysis project showcases a thorough analysis of human resources data using a combination of Excel, SQL, and Tableau. The project involved several key steps:

### Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, errors, and outliers from the dataset to ensure data integrity.
- Data Validation: Validated the data against predefined rules and criteria to ensure accuracy.
- Data Transformation: Transformed and structured the data for analysis using appropriate techniques.
  
### Data Analysis
- Exploratory Analysis: Utilized Excel for initial exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics and trends in the human resources data.                              
- Statistical Analysis: Performed statistical analysis to derive insights and identify patterns in the data.
- Database Analysis: Leveraged SQL queries to conduct deeper analysis and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
  
### Data Visualization
- Visualization Creation: Utilized Tableau to create interactive and informative visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- Insight Presentation: Presented findings and insights through visually appealing and informative visualizations to facilitate decision-making.

### Repository Structure
- Data: Contains the original dataset files and any processed data files.
- Code: Includes SQL scripts used for data analysis.
- Visualizations: Houses visualizations generated using Tableau.
  
### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises human resources data, including employee demographics, performance metrics, compensation details, and more.
